This lab consists in a set of exercises designed to teach you the basics of firmware programming using the
MSP430 family from Texas Instruments. Specific learning objectives include the following:
● Understand the capabilities and operation of microprocessors
● Read diagrams, memory maps, and instructions from the datasheet and the user’s guide
● Use the integrated development environment (IDE) for programming and debugging
● Configure internal clocks and their connection with peripheral units
● Configure and use digital I/O ports
● Configure and use interrupts
● Serial communications using the UART
● Analog-to-digital conversion
● Use the timer to generate and to measure precise timing
● Create a circular buffer to accept message packets from a PC
● Understand the difference between polling, interrupt-driven, and event-driven programs


Note: All programs written by Meet Nandu. The Excercises are designed and published by Dr. Hongshen Ma for MECH 423 at UBC
